# PDFMerger

Planned updates
- Better error-handling; program currently crashes if no PDFs have been loaded and buttons are pressed that rely on there being PDFs available
- Distributable app version for MacOS (i.e. .app version)

Version 2.0
First official GUI version that uses PyQT5. 

Version 1.0
Simple PDF merger that will merge all PDFs found in the directory in which the script is run. Imports PyPDF4.
